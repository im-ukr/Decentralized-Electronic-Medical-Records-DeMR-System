## A. Introduction

This project marks a significant advancement by successfully integrating blockchain technology into Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The primary objective is to enhance the security and privacy of patient data through blockchainâ€™s decentralized structure, ensuring data integrity and protection against unauthorized modifications.
This repository provides the necessary scripts and configurations for establishing a Hyperledger Fabric network and deploying chaincode.

## B. Installation
The following installations are preferred:
- Ubuntu 20.04+/ MacOS/ Ubuntu running on WSL2 (For Windows)
- Docker and WSL extension on Visual Studio Code
- Docker Desktop (If using WSL2 then ensure that WSL integration with Ubuntu is enabled under Docker desktop settings)
- Python 3 (for serving frontend via http.server)
- Node.js and nvm. (Check the versions mentioned at the end of this readme)

## C. Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/im-ukr/Decentralized-Electronic-Medical-Records-DeMR-System.git
   ```
   Navigate into the project folder:
    ```bash
   cd EMR-Management-System-using-Hyperledger-Fabric
   ```
   And then run these command:
    ```bash
   curl -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/main/scripts/install-fabric.sh
   chmod +x install-fabric.sh
   ./install-fabric.sh docker binary
   ```

3. **Navigate to the test network directory:**

   ```bash
   cd fabric-samples/test-network
   ```
   
5. **Execute the following commands to set up the network and deploy the chaincode:**

   ```bash
   ./network.sh down
   ./network.sh up createChannel -ca -s couchdb
   ./deploymentScript.sh
   ```
   ### For errors (Skip if no issues; continue from Step 4):
   If facing any peer binaries issue when starting the network, follow these commands in this directory:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s
   ```
   Note where the peer binary is located using following command, **MODIIFY it according to the project location within your system.**
   ```bash
   find ~/BT-Project/EMR-Management-System-using-Hyperledger-Fabric -name peer
   ```
   Export it to the path based on the location, for example:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/home/im-ukr/BT-Project/EMR-Management-System-using-Hyperledger-Fabric/fabric-samples/test-network/fabric-samples/bin
   ```
   Verify the peer version:
   ```bash
   peer version
   ```

6. **After the execution of the above commands, navigate to the backend-combined directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend-combined
   ```

7. **Enroll admin, register user, and start the application:**

   Before enrolling, run this command:
   ```bash
   npm install fabric-ca-client
   ```
   ```bash
   node enrollAdmin.js
   node registerUser.js
   node app.js
   ```

8. **To view Frontend**

   Open a new terminal and run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd EMR-Management-System-using-Hyperledger-Fabric/fabric-samples/test-network/frontend
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

## D. Steps to successfully close and re-run the project:
To close the project, stop the backend as well as frontend terminal and execute the following command in test-network directory:
   ```bash
   ./network.sh down
   ```
For running again, execute the following commands only as per their respective directories (mentioned earlier):
   ```bash
   ./network.sh up createChannel -ca -s couchdb
   ./deploymentScript.sh
   ```
   ```bash
   node enrollAdmin.js
   node registerUser.js
   node app.js
   ```
To view frontend, open a new terminal and run these commands:
   ```bash
   cd EMR-Management-System-using-Hyperledger-Fabric/fabric-samples/test-network/frontend
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
## E. Used:
- Node v23.7.0 / v20.18.1
- npm v10.9.2 / v10.8.2
- nvm v0.39.5
- docker v27.4.0
